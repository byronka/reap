      This is the summation of the present values of after tax
      cash flows to date.  Present value
      is calculated by dividing the After Tax Cash Flow 
      by (1 + discount rate)^number of compounding periods.
      In this case the compounding periods are months, so for example,
      the last month\'s equation would be (1 + discount rate)^360
	    for a 30 year mortgage.
	    \n\n
	    Assumption: For simplicity\'s sake, all present value calculations are
	    done on a yearly basis.  So, to be more specific, it is not the case
	    that each monthly balance is used to independently calculate present value
	    for accumulation.  Instead, all income and outlay for the year is

	    Assumption: the ATER shown for each year is meant to represent

	    The equation is meant to give an idea of value of the investment.  It also
	    provides an indication of what portion of the purchase value is paid
	    off each year.  For example, a capitalization rate of 10% means that
	    10% of the value of the investment is paid off by the income on the 
	    investment each year.
	    \n\n
	    It can also provide valuation of an investment.  For instance, if one expects
	    typical cap rates to be 10% in an area, then a property that provides $100,000

      to the rental income on this property.  Note that this
      value does not apply to the equity reversion (investment sale).
